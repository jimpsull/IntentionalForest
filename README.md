# IntentionalForest
I'd like to use randomization for bootstrap aggregating of records but use an intentional feature 
selection algorithm in place of the random subspace method.  Intentional selection will use PCA to score features.  
Features will be placed on teams similar to a snake draft format with additional logic to prevent collinear 
features from being on the same team.
